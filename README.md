# Project Description:
## Outline
We aim to emulate certain features of Google Docs to create a cloud-based collaboration application.

## 1
We will use both a email-based sign in and a Google authentication service for user authentication.

## 2
We are using Firestore.
We aim to have a table of Projects and a table of users and documents related to those projects to provide a simple way to collaborate on multiple documents at once.

## 3
We aim to provide a list of users currently working on a given document and to also provide consistent updates whenever a user makes a change to one of these documents.  

## 4
Private data would include: personal documents not shared with any other users
Shared data would include: project documents shared between all users on the project.

## 5
We plan to use React.js

## 6
Our tables will be formatted as such:
| Project Name  | Documents | Users |
| ------------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| English Presentation  | Presentation.ppt  | Joe, Cindy |
